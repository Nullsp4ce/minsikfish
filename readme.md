# Minsikfish

_When does a really basic engine surpass human strength?_<br/>_At that moment, what is the most contributing feature?_

**Minsikfish** is an experimental chess engine that seeks to find a minimal combination of features to compete in low ratings.

The study is also to feedback myself as a chess player and find aspects to improve more among others.

During development, the engine's CCRL rating is estimated and recorded. Current ratings and comparison of features can be found [here](matches/results.md).

## Build

Run this from the project root:

```
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
```

## Contributing

Unfortunately, Minsikfish is currently not open for contributions.
